# Flutter React Flow Integration Proof of Concept

A Flutter project that integrates React Flow using WebView and real-time databases.
Please note that this is a proof of concept and not a fully functional or stable implementation!
Mainly created for educational purposes and to showcase the potential of integrating React Flow into Flutter applications.

Its also a test of the openai modell o1-preview. 

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a Flutter package that wraps around the react-flow library, allowing developers to use advanced flow chart and node-based graph capabilities in their Flutter applications. The integration is achieved through WebView and utilizes real-time databases like Firebase or Supabase for data synchronization.
